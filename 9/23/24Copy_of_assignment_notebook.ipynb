WASHINGTON, DC -- CPSC, Weider Sporting Goods, Inc., of Woodland Hills, CA, announces that a voluntary repair program for certain E-130 Series Exercise Benches has been implemented. The moving part of the leg extension bar has entrapped consumers' fingers, resulting in serious lacerations and partially amputated fingers. Weider Sporting Goods, Inc. has received at least 38 reports of minor bruises, cuts, serious lacerations, and partially amputated fingers to consumers using the affected exercise benches. While performing the leg extention exercise, a consumer may remove his or her hands from the sides of the bench and grab the top of the leg extension bar. If the user's finger is placed in the open space between the end bar and leg extension bar, it can be trapped when the leg extension bar is raised. This repair program, which was initiated in March 1992, only applies to certain E-130 series benches with right angle leg extensions. Affected model numbers are: E130, E131, E131B, E133, E134 and E137. The benches were distributed from April 1991 through December 1991. Approximately 71,000 units were distributed to retail stores throughout the United States. The exercise benches were sold to consumers for approximately $80 each. To avoid injury, Weider Sporting Goods, Inc. is offering a free replacement cap attachment. Consumers should ensure that the cap is securely snapped into place and is not removed. The cap can be obtained by contacting Weider Customer Service toll- free at 1-800-685-5480. Consumers may also write to: Customer Service, Weider Sporting Goods, Inc., P.O. Box 68, Olney, IL 62450. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is announcing this repair program as a part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks associated with consumer products.

The Maxi Rower consists of two springs, each attached at one end to a common metal frame, and at the other end to separate handles. The user sits on a rolling seat with feet placed in a footrest that is attached to the frame. Overextending the spring on either product may cause it to break and to separate from the footrest bar or from the handle- bar. Upon separation, the spring and handle can strike the user causing eye injury, broken teeth, bruises, and lacerations to the face, head, groin and other parts of the body. Injuries have also occurred from sharp edges on the footrest bar of the Pull-Up Exerciser when the end plugs of the footrest bar come loose. Injuries, including broken bones, have occurred when the frame of the Maxi Rower tipped or broke causing the user to fall. The Commission learned of the problems with the stomach exercisers from a complaint to the Commission\\'s Consumer Hotline. Hanover House Industries reported 26 incidents associated with the Pull-Up Exerciser (1.5 million sold nationwide, 1981-1988), and 12 incidents with the Maxi Rower (701,365 sold nationwide, 1984-1989). Hanover House Industries is a catalog/mail order company. The program for these products applies only to those purchased by mail-order. Pull-Up Exercisers purchased from Hanover House Industries after 1988, and Maxi-Rowers purchased from Hanover House Industries after 1989, are not included in the program. Hanover House Industries is offering owners of the exercisers covered by the program a free retrofit kit for the Pull-Up Exerciser. It includes a restraining cord that is designed to prevent spring breakage and separation of the handle- bar from the spring. The kit also includes step-by-step assembly instructions that offer directions on how to secure the end plugs to the footrest. Hanover House Industries is offering owners of the Maxi Rower covered by the program who return a spring from the Maxi Rower, a credit for its original purchase price toward the purchase of another of its products. Consumers may obtain (1) the retrofit kit for the Pull-Up Exerciser; or (2) a credit on the Maxi Rower for a future catalog purchase by calling toll-free 1-800-338-2670. Consumers should immediately discontinue using the Pull-Up Exerciser until the retrofit kit is installed. Consumers who do not elect to repair the Pull-Up Exerciser should discard those units so that no one else may use them. Consumers who have the Maxi Rower should save the spring for return to the Hanover House Industries for the merchandise credit, and discard the remainder of those units.

The response rate to the earlier program was low; Schwinn subsequently received 10 additional reports of injury, bringing the total number injured to 30. The reports received by Schwinn indicate that unsupervised children and infants have been injured when their fingers or toes got caught in the rear sprocket-chain juncture point on the left side of the XR-5 exerciser, resulting in amputation or other personal injury. There have also been reports of injuries occurring at the front sprocket-chain juncture point on the right side of unmodified units. As the manufacturer of this product, Schwinn is concerned about any type of injury allegedly associated with its products. As a result, Schwinn Bicycle Company is again offering to install or provide, at no charge, a Chainguard Retro Fit Kit that should help prevent potential harm to unsupervised children. If you own an XR-5, make sure small children do not play on or around your XR-5 unit. As indicated in the unit's owner's manual, when the unit is not in use, tighten the tension control knob located on the control panel so the pedals cannot be turned by small children, or place the unit in a locked or secure room. If you own an XR-5 unit which has not been modified, you should immediately make arrangements with your local authorized Schwinn dealer for installation of an XR-5 Chainguard Retro Fit Kit (part #90518). Installation will be done at no charge to the consumer. If you are unable to bring in your XR-5 unit, call Schwinn's Consumer Relations Department at 1-800-633-0231, and they will send you a Chainguard Retro Fit Kit so that you can install it yourself. However, Schwinn recommends that you have your authorized Schwinn dealer make the installation. If you sold or gave away your XR-5 unit, please let the new owner know of this safety program or call 1-800-633-0231 with the name and address of the person who now owns the unit and Schwinn will contact the new owner.

The firm has notified CPSC of 82 such injuries. The injuries occurred when the spring broke and part of the spring struck the user\\'s foot, resulting in bruises, lacerations and fractures. The exercisers are a stair-climber type device consisting of two springs, each attached to a black foot pedal and mounted to a metal A-frame. Black or white metal tubular sections and a foam-padded handle are additional parts provided for consumers to assemble the A-frame exercisers. The unassembled products were sold in stores nationwide. The retail price was approximately $45.00. Dynamic Classics is alerting consumers to correct their exercisers with a free retrofit kit being offered by the firm. The kit provides springs with metal brackets on each end to prevent over-stressing and breaking of the end loops of the springs. Exer-Climbers and Promo-Steppers with the metal brackets attached to both ends of the springs do not require the corrective kit. Consumers should immediately discontinue using Exer- Climbers and Promo-Steppers without metal brackets attached to the ends of the springs. The products should not be used until the springs are replaced with the retrofit kit. Consumers should call Dynamic Classics, Ltd. toll-free at 1-800-284-8492 to receive a free retrofit kit.

Without boots, these machines may present a risk of crushing the user's foot. These machines are cabinet-style electrically operated exercisers that were sold to commercial health clubs for approximately $300.00 each. The user lies on the machine's padded bed with legs elevated and feet buckled loosely into foot pedals. The Commission investigated one case based on a Freedom of Information Request in which a 28-year-old woman suffered a crushing injury to the back of her foot when her foot fell off the machine's pedal during use and became entrapped in moving gears. The Commission believes that on approximately the first 30 of these Leg Toners manufactured in 1986, an unguarded opening around the base of the foot pedal allows access to moving parts inside the cabinet. Although the manufacturer, which is no longer in business, attempted to retrofit these machines with a protective boot around the base of the pedals, a Commission investigation found that not all of the 30 affected units were retrofitted.

Some two million exercisers of the earlier model were sold nationwide from 1984 to August 1987. Approximately 60 incidents have been reported to CPSC and the firm, most of which involved a broken spring or a footbar assemble coming apart. Consumers have experienced bruises, cuts and lacerations to the face and other parts of the body when the handlebar or spring stuck the user. Incidents showed that the spring of the Rowing Action Exerciser, if extended too far to withstand the stress, could snap. Dynamic Classics is offering owners of the older models a free retrofit kit, which is designed to prevent the spring breaking and the footbar separating. The retrofit kit includes a safety cord to prevent over-stretching and over-stressing the spring, metal brackets to prevent over-stressing the spring loop, and a new extended footbar to prevent separation. Rowing Action Exercisers sold after August 1987 do not need retrofitting. They can be identified by metal brackets already attached to the top and bottom of the spring and a safety cord installed inside the spring. Earlier models had no brackets and a longer safety cord. Consumers should immediately discontinue the use of older models of the Rowing Action Exerciser, which do not have metal brackets attached to both ends of the spring.

The approximate retail price for model 714 is $399.00 and, for model 718E, $459.00. The climbers use digital readouts to apprise the user of his speed, elapsed time and total steps. CPSC said the red pulley cord and black roller in the center section of the device creates a pinch point and has no finger guard. Precor and CPSC are aware of three incidents of finger amputation or laceration when a child placed a finger between the pulley and the roller during use. CPSC urges all owners of this simulated stair climbing device to contact Precor immediately and obtain free a finger guard repair kit. Consumers may contact their nearest Precor dealer or call toll-free 1-800-662-0606.

(Oct. 19) -- Beacon Enterprises, Inc., of Yonkers, N.Y., is conducting a program to replace the seat-attachment hardware on more than 120,000 stationary exercise bikes because of reports that some customers failed to follow the assembly instructions properly and were seriously injured when the metal seat post unexpectedly broke through the seat. The manufacturer, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, announced that the voluntary recall involves units of its Scandia model 462 dual-action cycler built between August 1976 and July 1980. The bikes were sold under the Beacon name through catalogs of major merchandisers including Montgomery Ward and Alden's, and at a number of retail stores nationwide, Some units also were sold through catalogs of Sears, Roebuck and Co, under the Sears name as model 2930. Retail prices ranged from about $20 to $30. No exercise bikes other than Beacon's Scandia model 462 or the Sears model 2930 are involved in the recall. Beacon and the CPSC warn that if customers ignore the products assembly instructions and neglect to secure the seat with a bolt and nut supplied in the parts bag accompanying each bike, the unit's plastic seat may be punctured by the seat post. The CPSC said that no reports of injury were received when the bikes were properly assembled. According to the CPSC, six injuries were reported between 1979 and 1981. No injuries were reported from bikes sold by Alden's or Sears. As part of its voluntary program, the manufacturer is providing a free replacement kit consisting of a bolt, lock washer, nut, warning decal, and instructions for attaching the seat. The kit also tells customers how to look for signs of possible seat failure, The CPSC said that design changes for the seat mount which the company made starting in August 1980 limit the recall to units manufactured before that date. Exercise bikes built after August 1980 bear orange-red decals on the seat tops. The agency said that owners of units without the seat bolt and nut in place should stop using them and contact the manufacturer. Owners of units with the bolt and nut in place should make sure that the nut is secured tightly. Beacon has established a 24-hour telephone service to provide full information about the product and to take orders for the free replacement kits. Consumers are urged to call 212-683-9288 collect for further details about the recall.\", 'URL': 'https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1981/Seat-Attachment-Parts-To-Be-Replaced-On-120000-Exercise-Bikes', 'Title': 'Seat Attachment Parts On Exercise Bikes Replaced by Beacon', 'ConsumerContact': None, 'LastPublishDate': '2014-12-18T00:00:00', 'Products': [{'Name': 'Beacon stationary bicycles', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': '', 'CategoryID': '', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}, {'Name': 'Scandia dual-action cycler', 'Description': '', 'Model': '', 'Type': 'Exercise Machines/Equipment', 'CategoryID': '1933', 'NumberOfUnits': ''}], 'Inconjunctions': [], 'Images': [], 'Injuries': [], 'Manufacturers': [{'Name': 'Sears', 'CompanyID': ''}, {'Name': 'Beacon Enterprises', 'CompanyID': ''}, {'Name': 'Montgomery Ward', 'CompanyID': ''}, {'Name': \"Alden's\", 'CompanyID': ''}], 'Retailers': [], 'Importers': [], 'Distributors': [], 'SoldAtLabel': None, 'ManufacturerCountries': [], 'ProductUPCs': [], 'Hazards': [{'Name': 'Fall', 'HazardType': '', 'HazardTypeID': ''}], 'Remedies': [], 'RemedyOptions': []}]\n"

        "Each of these API resources could either be the cornerstone of a project or a source of additional data. These data sources have a number of advantages: They're free, most of them can be accessed using the same API key, and most have similar documentation for how to write a query. This is ideal for students to iterate, experiment, and take risks, with little cost to failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to government data, many commerical apps provide API access to developers and researchers. AirBnB, Amazon, Reddit, eBay, X, and many others maintain API access to develop third-party apps. These opportunities present many advantages: The data are larger, have more variety, and there are vastly many more cases. Building a third-party app that includes analytics could easily consume an entire semester and open a variety of applications in predictive analytics, natural language processing, and generative AI (e.g. predict which reviews are fake or real for Amazon for a product group like ``women's watches', and then make recommendations for different price points). While an exciting possibility, this can also raise a lot of problems: Some API's cost money or are rate-limited depending on a subscription, and others impose significant constraints on how the data can be used. In some cases, a more useful approach might be explicit web scraping using a package like BeautifulSoup or Selenium. For example, Craigslist has no API, but can easily and productively be scraped using BeautifulSoup.\n",

        "**5. Pick an API, download some data, wrangle them, and produce some EDA results, as we did in the previous steps with the saferproducts.gov API; or, if you can't get it to work, document why. If you have the time and it's low cost, push the results to a streamlit page. If you have had enough, I recommend https://www.eia.gov/opendata/browser/electricity, since there is a friendly query builder that you can use to learn.**"
